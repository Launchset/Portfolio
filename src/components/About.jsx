        <h2>The Person Behind the Code</h2>
        <p>
          Hi, I’m <strong>John</strong> — a web developer and boxer who builds websites and booking systems for boxing gyms.
        </p>
        <p>
          After years training in local gyms, I saw firsthand how a lack of online presence and clunky booking systems were holding great coaches back. Missed sessions, lost sign-ups, endless admin—it adds up.
        </p>
        <p>
          That’s why I combine my coding skills with my passion for the sport—creating fast, mobile-friendly websites that make it easier for boxing gyms to fill classes, manage schedules, and grow their business.
        </p>
        <p>
          With a background in finance and automation, I focus on building clean systems that save time and reduce stress—so coaches can spend more time training fighters, and less time chasing paperwork.
        </p>
        <p>
          I don’t just build sites—I partner with gyms to help them run smoother, look more professional, and stay competitive in a digital world.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you run a boxing gym and want your website to actually work for you, let’s build something that punches above its weight.
