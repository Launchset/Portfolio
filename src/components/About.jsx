        <h2>The Person Behind the Code</h2>
        <p>
          Hi, I’m <strong>John</strong> — an Accounting & Finance student with a passion for technology, automation, and building things that actually move the needle.
        </p>
        <p>
          I'm driven by projects that make a real impact. I bring a mix of finance knowledge, coding experience, and automation tools to help businesses — especially in fitness and fintech — run smoother, grow faster, and spend less time on manual work.
        </p>
        <p>
          My goal is to work <strong>with</strong> businesses, not just <strong>for</strong> them — creating win-win partnerships where I contribute real value through tech and automation, while gaining real experience from you.
        </p>
        <p>
          Whether you’re a gym owner looking to modernise, a startup needing a site that works as hard as you do, or someone with a bold idea — if it’s interesting, I’m in.
        </p>
